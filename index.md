## The Opportunity

In the next 20-30 years, robots and AI, augmented and virtual reality, digital fabrication, and other forms of emerging tech will radically transform our economy, creating a staggering amount of wealth.

Big Tech says they'll empower people by democratizing this new tech. But that's what they said about the last wave of tech -- personal computers, the Internet, smart phones, and social media. While folks from Harlem to Harlan County did become skilled users of this tech, creating an explosion of creativity in the form of websites, TikToks, etc., few benefited from the wealth it generated. If anything, this previous wave of tech was part of an economy where wages for most workers stagnated and many communities were left behind.

How do we prevent the tech world from failing so many communities during the next wave of tech as it did in the last one? By ensuring that this time all our communities help shape how emerging tech is made and used. 

## 1) What to Do

To do so, we'll need to focus our efforts on three areas:

- __Tech Jobs__:  help communities reshape emerging tech so black, white, and brown people in every community have a real shot at getting good paying jobs in tech and/or creating co-ops & small businesses.
- __Non-Tech Jobs__: Big Tech says AI/robots won't be a job killer, it'll allow people to focus more of their job on the creative work that computers can't do. Let's cash in this promise by helping everyone from nurses to carpenters shape the direction of emerging tech, creating more room for creativity and meaning in their jobs -- and in doing so benefit from the wealth they help create.
- __Low-Wage Jobs That Sustain the Economy__:  as #1 and #2 build a more prosperous economy, reinvest some of this new wealth back in care work jobs and other jobs that pay poorly today but that make everyone's work possible.

## 2) How To Do It

- [Reshape the Tools](tools/): create  a new model for democratizing tech expertise that makes it easier to move from beginner to intermediate to master and from tool user to tool maker.
 - [Reshape the Opportunities](jobs-training/):


## 3) [How to Get There](make-it-happen/): Bending the Arc of the Next 20-30 Years


Although this approach is doable, it's not something we can pull off overnight. How can we help black, white, and brown families in their struggles to make a living today while also taking advantage of this once in a century opportunity to shape the direction of emerging tech and the economy -- especially in the next few years, when the direction of new tech is much more malleable?

- Make Major Progress Now: we can't change emerging tech fast enough to create lots of good paying jobs very quickly on a scale that would make a real difference in communities from Harlem to Harlan County. So the best way for folks in tech to fundamentally transform jobs in communities right now is by supporting actions that can pay off much faster:
  - Good green jobs created by a Green New Deal
  - Campaigns to raise the minimum wage and campaigns by low-wage workers to organize
- Create Experiments Today That Build Towards Tomorrow -- including supporting and learning from [current struggles](make-it-happen/) in other/related approaches to emerging tech
