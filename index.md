In the next 20-30 years, robots and AI, augmented and virtual reality, digital fabrication, and other forms of emerging tech will radically transform our economy, creating a staggering amount of wealth.

Many people in tech hope we will empower millions by democratizing this new technology. But given the shape of the tech industry today, few of the jobs and wealth generated by emerging tech are likely to end up in communities who are already struggling.

If anything, for all the talk about empowering more people, the tech world as it's structured now is just as likely to develop robots and AI that lay the foundation for an economy that's even more unequal than it is today.

Makers All is an initiative to figure out how communities from Harlem to Harlan County can shape the direction of emerging tech so black, white, and brown families in every community can thrive and prosper. This toolkit is a collection of links, ideas, and other resources for implementing the Makers All's vision.
