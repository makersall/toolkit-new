# Makers All Toolkit

The Makers All toolkit started out as a web version of [Makers All's](https://makersall.org/) flagship report, [Makers All: How to Help Communities
Transform Emerging Tech So They Can Shape Their Destinies](https://makersall.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Makers-All-Report.pdf).  The report is a v0.1 of Makers All's strategy. As that strategy evolves, the toolkit will become a repository for examples, best practices, links, etc of the strategy and lessons we learned the hard way about how to implement it.

The toolkit is located at [toolkit.makersall.org](https://toolkit.makersall.org/).
