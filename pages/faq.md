### Isn't Coding Too Hard to Expect Most People to Do It?

Today, there's no way to know how many people could become skilled enough at coding to make a living either as a full-fledged developer or a power user or blue-collar coder. The reason we can't yet answer the question is that we haven't tried with the degree of commitment and the amount of resources necessary to find out.

It's quite understandable that many people today think coding is too hard for lots of folks to do it. But that's because for all the hard work that's gone into our coding effort so far, compared to Extension Services, we've still got a long way to go:

- The tech world has never been focused enough on making programming languages, libraries, and frameworks accessible to the community in the way that Extension Services translated modern agricultural practices. All you need to do is go to a typical yearly conference on Python, JavaScript, or some other language or framework, and look for talks or workshops about the nuts and bolts of making coding tools easier for everyday adults; you'll be lucky if you find one or two. Or to put it another way, when tech hiring sites have dozens of job postings for community-oriented coding UX experts, then we can start asking whether coding is truly too hard.
- As hard as folks in the community are working on making tech more accessible, the resources they have are a drop in the bucket compared to Extension Services. For example, as the report notes, by 1948 New York State's Extension Services had built a network of 32,000 trained volunteer local leaders and committee members, who were supported by 383 agricultural and home economics staff who were affiliated with colleges and universities. That's an impressive number by any standard, but it's stunning considering that it was approximately 1.5% of New York State's rural population.   Given the communication tools we have at our disposal, we won't need that many volunteer activists. But we will certainly need far more resources and people that are currently invested.

Moreover, it's important that we don't conflate 3 issues: how much formal training you need to be a skilled coder, how hard coding is to master, and whether many people could learn to do it.  You don't need to have taken classes in chemistry to know how to bake cookies. That doesn't mean that becoming a truly skilled baker isn't hard.  But we don't assume becoming a skilled baker is too hard for most people to get a job doing it.

The real issue isn't whether coding is hard, it's whether we can break down coding and provide enough support so millions of people can do this hard work. The only way to find out is to step up our game and try.

Finally, it's worth keeping in mind that the goal of Makers All isn't to train all adults to become coders. Not everyone is going to become a programmer or designer. The goal is to train enough people in every community so that a big enough slice of the wealth created by emerging tech is invested in every community so it can act as a foundation for ensuring all communities prosper.

### Extension Services Was Helping People Who Already Knew How to Farm. Isn't That Much Easier Than Teaching People How to Code from Scratch?

It's easy from our vantage point to assume that farming is basically farming and that if you already know the basics of farming, learning modern agricultural techniques wasn't that great a leap. But history shows otherwise.

The first major effort to train farmers in the skills of modern agriculture was the Morrill Act, which created the Land-Grant College system, was passed in 1862.  Before that, there were several decades worth of volunteer efforts to train farmers. Cooperative Extension Services were created by the Smith Lever act in 1914, which drew upon the experiments of many states. In other words, it took at least 50 years to figure out how to train millions of farmers in modern agricultural techniques -- not exactly a sign that it was easy. 

Part of the reason it was so difficult to bring about the modern agricultural transformation is that farming is an incredibly risky business. If a beginning coder is trained in a new tool for handling bugs in their programs and it turns out that this isn't as effective as the previous tools and techniques for handling bugs, it isn't hugely expensive to recover from that mistake.  But if our former switches to a new technique for handling bugs on their wheat crop and the new technique doesn't work, they could lose most or all of their crop. They could go bankrupt. Their kids might go hungry.  

In short, if you look at the totality of the experience of 19th century farmers switching to new techniques vs. learning to code from scratch today, the gap is far smaller than it might appear at first glance.
