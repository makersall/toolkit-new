title: Smooth the Learning Curve
# image:
---
Most efforts at democratizing emerging tech focus on training people to use the tech as it is.  But learning to code is too hard for us to train enough people to make a big difference. We need to do for emerging tech coding what Extension Services did for agriculture tech: make it much easier for everyday adults to learn.

We already have the techniques to do it: user experience design (UX).  In the worlds of web and mobile, UX has had a profound impact on how designers work.  But when it comes the coding languages and frameworks that are used to build those websites and apps? Not so much.

If we're going to democratize emerging tech, we need to use UX in a community-oriented way to smooth the learning curve for programming.
