title: 'Combating Climate Change: from Dashboards to Game Boards'

In a world where analytics, algorithms, IOT, and other forms of tech are increasingly important, how do we create civic life that more deeply engages people in the nuts and bolts deliberative process of democracy? Is there a way that what game designers know can be brought to bear?

For example, large cities and states are going to play a crucial role in combating climate change, and many already have ambitious plans in place. But odds are nobody but a handful of policy nerds and politicos know anything about it, and whatever dingy little public dashboard they've created gets viewed by almost no one

Games are a great way to engage people, and if they are properly designed they can be a good way to encapsulate a lot of complexity. So, what if we were to design a game/platform that allowed cities, counties, states, etc. to do two things:

1. Allow its citizens to play a game that gives them a better nuts and bolts sense of the options and trade-offs involved in this locality reducing CO2 emissions using environmental justice principles.
 -  Designed to entice people in and then gradually increase their understanding of these issues as they "level up"
- Possibly designed so that groups of people can play as teams?
- Eventually, design the game so it's configuration based, so different groups can set different assumptions -- and in doing so designed to help citizens gain a more critical understanding of how algorithms, etc. work.

2. Design the game/platform so that instead of creating clunky old dashboards, cities could create game -like boards in which you could see how your city is doing and where there are places to intervene over time. And encourage collaboration -- and possibly a little from the competition -- across localities, as well as bringing in community groups, Code for America, academics, etc.

If it succeeds, it could be used as a model for other areas of civic deliberation.
