### Where does this go?

Both for
- Tech job: code craft , analyst, citizen data scientist
- enhancing jobs: making room for more money, creativity -- what AI people say it will allow (healthcare workers, home care workers)



## Goals

- I'm in a meeting with the BabylonJS team, what strategy memo do I want on my website?
- How do I prep myself for this eventual moment the way I could’ve for Green New Deal?  What does the equivalent look like?

- Who do I interview / network with so that when it’s time, my ideas have been circulating, so folks might turn to me, so someone they know would know my schtick?

NOTE: do Freewriting on each of these
