Interested in learning about or trying out [Makers All](https://makersall.org/)'s strategies? This toolkit can help you out.

The Makers All toolkit started out as a way to break up Makers All's [flagship report](https://makersall.org/resources/) into smaller, bite sized pieces so it's easier to look around, skim through some ideas, and find what you want. 

As Makers All Grows, the toolkit will grow into a repository for all of the strategies, tactics, and ideas behind Makers All. 

The toolkit and the report it is based on were developed by Anders Schneiderman, Makers All's director. He is a sociologist turned techie, with over 30 years of experience as a developer, software project manager and adult tech trainer at labor unions, corporations, nonprofits, and government.  He can be reached by email (aschneiderman a.t makersall do.t org) or Twitter ([@raschneiderman](https://twitter.com/raschneiderman)).
