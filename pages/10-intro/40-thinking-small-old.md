Ultimately, the most important lesson we can learn from Extension Services and Citizenship Schools is that we can't be afraid to think big.

Why does the idea of training millions of people in emerging tech coding seem like wishful thinking? Because just like our first attempts to revolutionize agricultural training, our solutions so far aren't up to the challenge. For example:

- Most community-based tech training efforts can only get funding for a fraction of the resources they need.
- Unlike Extension Services, our current efforts aren't accountable at the scale we need. We don't regularly ask, are we transforming every community?

The tech world prides itself on being insanely ambitious.  But the reason we're failing so many communities is that so far, we haven't been ambitious enough.  That's understandable; until now, we didn't realize that there were models that showed what a truly ambitious program could accomplish.

We have a rare opportunity to make more emerging tech jobs more accessible today and to create a better future for all tomorrow. But to seize it, we need to think boldly, dream, and then act on a large enough scale to realize those dreams.
