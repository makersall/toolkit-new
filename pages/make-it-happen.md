Although this approach is doable, it's extremely ambitious -- and it's not something we can pull off overnight. And in the meantime, there are so many problems that need our attention right now. 

How can we help black, white, and brown families in their struggles to make a living today while also taking advantage of this once in a century opportunity to shape the direction of emerging tech and the economy -- especially in the next few years, when the direction of new tech is much more malleable?


### A) Make Major Progress Now: Support the Green New Deal and Organizing Low-Wage Jobs

Although it's certainly worth trying to make tech jobs more accessible today, it's hard to see how we can change emerging tech fast enough to create lots of good paying jobs very quickly on a scale that would make a real difference in communities from Harlem to Harlan County.

But we don't need to. The best way for folks in tech to fundamentally transform jobs in communities right now is by supporting actions that can pay off much faster:
- Good green jobs created by a Green New Deal
- Campaigns to raise the minimum wage and campaigns by low-wage workers to organize

### B) Create Experiments Today That Build Towards Tomorrow

_I have a bunch of thoughts on what this might look like, but they're still pretty vague. For now, here are a few snippets._


We need to experiment in a way that's headed somewhere, that is headed toward scaling, towards adding up to something that really pays off.

Some Strategies for Experimentation
- Learn from the good parts of start up culture -- e.g., [MVPs](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mvp/)
- Help geographic clusters of small community tech groups build grassroots power together and level up
- Support and learn from current struggles in other/related approaches to emerging tech -- e.g., the [Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org/)'s strategy for building [equitable and accountable AI](https://www.ajl.org/about), [Data for Black Lives](https://d4bl.org/)'s [#NoMoreDataWeapons](https://blog.d4bl.org/introducing-nomoredataweapons/) campaign, the [Design Justice Network](https://designjustice.org/)
- Look for ways to add more playful approaches to tech to make it less intimidating, to encourage learning & creative exploration

Traps to Look out for
