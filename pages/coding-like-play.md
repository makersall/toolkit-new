title: Making Coding More Like Play

Projects like code.org are a fun way to get a peek at the world of coding; they make coding feel more like a game. But if you decide you want to take the next step towards programming in the real world, you switch from playing with Star Wars characters to wrestling with intimidatingly geeky syntax and painfully obscure error messages.

We know that digital games and other forms of digital toys can seduce people into spending huge amounts of time on them.  What if we were to reimagine the user experience of software development so it felt more like a game?

To do so, we would need to iteratively develop with communities a new, collaborative approach designing coding environments -- game design thinking? An approach that:

- Reimagines coding to be more enticing and/or playful
- Smooths the learning curve, so there are continual opportunities to "level up" your developer skills
- Treats learning to code not as an isolated act but as something that's grounded in community, so that people in churches, unions, and other places where they come together could become places that encourage and support exploring tech
- Uses critical participatory design, Design Justice, etc. in such a way to help marginalized communities build grassroots power so they have a seat at the table
- Encourages people who've been locked out to not only be makers of content but also makers of the tools/platforms used to create content

If we could start to bend the arc of coding, over the long term we could open up amazing opportunities:
- Access to a range of full-time coding jobs, from power users to "blue-collar coders" to highly sophisticated developers so there are more ways for folks who've been locked out to get a job in tech
- Creating a world in which everyone from nurses to carpenters to home care workers can shape the direction of emerging tech, creating more room for creativity in their jobs -- and in doing so to benefit from the wealth they help create. 

### Small Steps

Transforming the user experience of coding is a daunting task. How do we find a place to begin?  By finding the right place or places to intervene, where we can show what's possible and inspire others to take the leap.

Building a language/framework from scratch is hard to do, and you have no way of knowing if it will ever be successfully adopted, let alone that there will be jobs available using it. So, start by finding one right framework/platform where there is already a community of developers and at least some jobs.




Here's an example of one way of taking these first few steps:
- Choose an open source development framework that's already relatively established. For example:
  - BabylonJS is a popular web XR library that uses a mix of coding and drag-and-drop tools
  - pandas/Jupyter/etc. for data science & data engineering -- which unlike proprietary systems such as  Alteryx or Microsoft's Azure mapping data flows hasn't explored ways of making data engineering more accessible
- Hold a series of conversations in either 1 or 2 communities -- e.g., LatinX communities in Orange County and groups in either West Virginia or Kentucky (where there are more groups, e.g., Appalshop) that lead up to one or more weekend design hackathons where the goal is to generate a couple of ideas of how one might transform this development framework to make it more accessible and more game-like
- Start talking more seriously with the open source development framework community about whether they would be open to trying out a POC/MVP of one of the ideas

Where this might ultimately go: involving rank-and-file union activists in home care or nursing home care in reimagining what more malleable/codeable XR software might look like for building a stronger connection and collaboration between, for example, elders and their children who don't live in the same city/state.
